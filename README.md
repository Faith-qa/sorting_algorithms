#Sorting algorithm
=============================
##Bubble sort -
---------------------------
This is a simple method that sorts arrays into either increasing or decreasing
order by comparing adjascent elements and swapping them if they are out of
order
Multiple passes through the array are necessary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##Insertion sort -
-----------------------
in insertion sorting, an array iss virtually split into a sorted and unsorted
part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct
position in the sorted part.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
##Selection sort -
-------------------
the selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minium
element from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. it simply
sets the first location to the minimum element, searches the minimum element
in the array, swaps the first location with the minimum value and assigns the
second element as the min.

Repeats the process.
